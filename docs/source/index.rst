*An AI-enabled camera trap design targeted at the* **Raspberry Pi platform**.

DynAIkonTrap makes use of a continuous stream from a camera attached to the Raspberry Pi, analysing only the stream to detect animals. Animal detections can be used to save or send individual frames from the video, or even whole video segments. The beauty of this is that the system does not rely on any secondary sensors like PIR sensors and acts on exactly what the camera sees.
