These instructions assume you have very little, if any, experience using Raspberry Pis. You may be familiar with some of the topics covered in this setup guide, but it may be worth having a read through everything in case there is something you have not come across before, or something project-specific.

We hope that this reads like a very simple and easy to follow usage guide. If anything is unclear please get in touch at cameratrap@dynaikon.com and we'll try to help you out. If you report difficulties in the setup process we can also update this guide so the next person finds it a little easier.

.. note::
    We will frequently use the abbreviation RPi for Raspberry Pi.

You will need ...
-----------------

* Raspberry Pi (model 4 is recommended, although other models may work)
* Micro SD card (and an adapter to flash the SD from your computer)
* Power supply for the Raspberry Pi
* Camera
* Ethernet cable, if you won't use Wi-Fi

for a minimal camera trap setup. Take a look at our :doc:`assembly-and-deployment` guide for a more in-depth look at hardware requirements, suggestions, and hardware setup instructions.

Software Setup

The rest of the software setup guide is structured as follows:

#. :doc:`software-setup/flashing`
#. :doc:`software-setup/manual-installation`
#. :doc:`software-setup/running`
#. :doc:`software-setup/tuning`

It is recommended that you start at step one and follow the instructions in order. Each of the above pages will guide you to the next page to look at at.
